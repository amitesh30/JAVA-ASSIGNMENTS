# Part 1:

Define the generic Shapes interface with methods that describe common attributes and behavior for all shapes.
Implement the concrete classes Circle, Triangle, and Rectangle that inherit from the Shapes interface and provide their own unique implementation of the methods defined in the interface.
# Part 2:

Define the abstract class for the basic building block for employees in a personnel database, with attributes and methods that are common to all employees.
Implement two concrete classes that inherit from the abstract class and provide their own unique implementation of the methods and attributes. These classes can represent different types of employees such as full-time and part-time employees.
Test the implementation of both the abstract class and concrete classes to ensure they are working correctly and as expected.
